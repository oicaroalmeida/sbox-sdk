# jose

> (Browser Runtime) 'JSON Web Almost Everything' - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK with no dependencies using Web Cryptography API.

⚠️ This distribution only supports the Browser runtime.
Its purpose is to offer a distribution of `jose` with a smaller bundle/install
size before tree-shaking.

For the universal module see [npmjs.com/package/jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose)

## Support
